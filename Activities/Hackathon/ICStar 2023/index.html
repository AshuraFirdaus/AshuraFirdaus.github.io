              <h3>July 18th, 2023</h3>
              <p>
                During my college times, other than lecture and study from the
                college i actively seeking other way to keep myself up to date
                with the technology advancement and upskill myself, one of the
                best way i heard to have a direct experience other than working
                is try to join up an hackathon so i look for one and then i
                stumble upon ICStar Hackathon 2023 announcement on instagram and
                without hesitation i immediately sign myself up to try what a
                hackathon is about, i thought everyone can join immediately but
                turns out there's a test to enter and good for me that i was
                able to pass all the required test to join the ICStar Hackathon
                2023. After that i got the invitation for the kick off of the
                hackathon and for a short period of time we get the training for
                materials such as RPA with IBM RPA, Artificial Intelligence
                using Python, Create our own full stack app using Java
                Springboot and Angular.js.

              <p>
                After the training period of time was concluded, each of the
                participant then are teaming up with another and given a user
                problem case to be solved i got myself to be the part of team 7
                and in my team case it was given by Adira Finance to solve one
                of their real world daily use case problem for us to help solve
                it by using IBM RPA tools. My team then look into the problem
                and we collaborate between each other along with the mentors and
                the user from Adira Finance via a routine meetup each week to
                discuss how far our progress is moving, and after a few weeks it
                was our demo day to showcase are we capable to solve the problem
                given to us by Adira Finance.

                Turns out our project was one of the few that successfuly
                selected to continue to the Final stage, our mentors then direct
                us to prepare for the final like how we should create a
                presentation and prepare ourselves to talk in front of the end
                user audience from big companies like BCA, KB Data Systems,
                Indosat Ooredo, IBM, IDStar and of course our case end user
                Adira Finance itself, we then have a few weeks to prepare to
                solve all the rest of the problem to be given during the final
                round. During the final Dewa, Putri and myself try our best to
                showcase our idea about how to approach and solve the problems
                that are given to us, the judge were pleased by our idea but we
                still have much to learn because we were too nervous when we try
                to showcase our ideas.

                After a brief period of the judges assest the score for all the
                finalist, they then announced the winner for 2023 hackathon and
                turns out my team is not the winner, i am a little bit
                dissapointed because i feel i might also lost because im not
                giving my best but then my team assure that we already give it
                our everything and its always worth to try and what are the most
                important things is we finish what we start and reaching the
                final stage alone is no such easy task when your opponent is
                from across Indonesia and Malaysia's most prestigious college.

              <p>
                During my time attending the hackathon, i learned a lot about
                tech materials such as RPA, using Java with Springboot and
                Angular.js, OCR using Python among many other and meet a lot of
                new people that share the same interest in the technology world,
                that alone is what makes this hackathon worth so much more to
                what i set up myself to follow this hackathon that is to upskill
                myself, turns out i learned so much more like what are the real
                world use case that some big companies are facing off during the
                time and what can i get from learning and how to solve real
                world companies problem. In the end this hackathon really
                improves myself both on hardskill and softskill and i learned a
                lot during my time and what most important is it is fun!.
